The levels will be notated the following way:
There will be two numbers: (first number)_(second number)

The levels will be split into 6 columns (Hopefully you see what I mean). The first number will signify which column the level appears in, starting from the left and starting at 1. 
The second number will signify at which height the level appears relative to the other levels in the same column, with 1 being the highest, 2 being the middle, and 3 being the lowest. 

Levels that take up one column by itself will have the second number omitted.
